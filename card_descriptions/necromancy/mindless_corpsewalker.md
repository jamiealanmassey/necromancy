## __Description__
The Mindless Corpsewalker is a standard minion type that can be summoned to the field to push out quick damage at a cheap cost. These specific types of minions are so modified beyond the standard follower that they cannot be sacrificed for souls.

Apply this process has a great effect on tearing apart their souls from the etheral plane.

## __Flavour Text__
_"He draws closer. Thud. Thud. Thud... My heart beats faster; mindless as he moves, slow and docile, but, always drawing nearer. He can smell my fear and I lose concious for but a second. And then it happens, he wraps his putrid hand around my neck, and the world stops. I draw my final breath..."_ - Unknown Civilian, 1854 AD
