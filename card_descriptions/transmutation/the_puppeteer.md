## __Flavour Text__
_"Like a crack ripping through the sound of the battlefield. I cackle, I scream with glee, another victim beset before me. A whip of my strings, a lash to the face, wrapped around your neck - your soul I will take. One more giggle, a flick of my wrist, a pull on the string, and off we go, into the mist!"_ - ___A Pulling of Strings___ by The Puppeteer, 1830 AD
