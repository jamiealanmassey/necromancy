# __Game Mechanics__

## Basic Game Rules
Leech minions can take health from other enemy minions varying on their own attack level. That health then gets refunded to the Player that attacks. 

The Playerâ€™s health starts at 100. To play minions in the game the player must pay with their own health and therefore more powerful minions are more risky to summon.

Souls are the byproduct of sacrificing minions. You can use these souls in addition to your health to summon demons from the Demonology tree of magic, which tend to be a lot stronger than minions that are available to you in the Necromancy tree of magic.

Spell cards do not require you to pay any resources to be played unless stated otherwise and come under the Transmutation tree of magics. Spell cards are used to change the game. 

Spirituality cards have the specific mechanic of sacrificing minions on the board (be they friendly or not) to restore health back to the player.

You may have as many Necromancy and Spirituality cards in your deck as you wish. Demonology cards are limited to one of each unique card. No more than five Transmutation cards may be in your deck. There is a total limit of thirty cards to a deck.
