# __Game Mechanics__
## Basic Game Rules
__Leech__ minions can take health from other enemy minions varying on their own attack level. That health then gets refunded to the Player that attacks. 

The Player’s __health__ starts at 100. To play minions in the game the player must pay with their own health and therefore more powerful minions are more risky to summon.

__Souls__ are the byproduct of sacrificing minions. You can use these souls in addition to your health to summon demons from the __Demonology__ tree of magic, which tend to be a lot stronger than minions that are available to you in the __Necromancy__ tree of magic.

__Spell__ cards do not require you to pay any resources to be played unless stated otherwise and come under the __Transmutation__ tree of magics. Spell cards are used to change the game. 

__Spirituality__ cards have the specific mechanic of __sacrificing__ minions on the board (be they friendly or not) to restore health back to the player.

You may have as many __Necromancy__ and __Spirituality__ cards in your deck as you wish. __Demonology__ cards are limited to one of each unique card. No more than five __Transmutation__ cards may be in your deck. There is a total limit of thirty cards to a deck.
